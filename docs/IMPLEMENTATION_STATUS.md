## Partial Or UI-Limited

- The backend supports direct email-only OTP login through `/auth/request-otp` and `/auth/verify-otp`, but the current Flutter sign-in screen is password-first.
- Seeded buyer and seller demo users do not have passwords by default.
- Seller listing editing exists in the backend, but the Flutter "My listings" UI currently exposes only mark sold, remove, and republish actions.
- Admin listing update exists in the backend, but the React admin table currently exposes only price editing.
- Report review can resolve or dismiss reports. Direct one-click moderation actions from a report card are not currently implemented.
- Search analytics are based on logged text searches. Filter-only searches are not logged as search terms.

## Not Currently Implemented

- Image messaging or file attachments in chat.
- Voice or video calls.
- Online payments, escrow, delivery integration, seller fees, paid promotions.
- Ratings, identity verification, and automated image moderation.
- Multi-admin permission levels.
- iOS app.
- Google Play signing and store publication automation.

## Source Of Truth

- Database schema: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Mobile app behavior: `mobile/lib`
- Admin app behavior: `admin/src`
