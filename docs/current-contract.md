# PocketTrade API Contract

Base URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Authenticated routes require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Swagger UI is available at `/api-docs`.

## Authentication

The backend supports two user authentication paths:

- Email/password accounts through registration and login.
- Email OTP verification through `request-otp` and `verify-otp`, which creates the account automatically if it does not already exist.

The Flutter app currently uses email/password for normal sign-in, OTP after registration, and OTP for password reset.

```text
POST /auth/register
Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "minimum-8-chars" }
Returns: OTP metadata. Verify with /auth/verify-otp.
```

```text
POST /auth/login
Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "minimum-8-chars" }
Returns: accessToken, refreshToken, user
```

```text
POST /auth/forgot-password
Body: { "email": "user@example.com" }
```

```text
POST /auth/reset-password
Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "code": "123456", "password": "minimum-8-chars" }
Returns: accessToken, refreshToken, user
```

```text
POST /auth/request-otp
Body: { "email": "user@example.com" }
```

```text
POST /auth/verify-otp
Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "code": "123456" }
Returns: accessToken, refreshToken, user, isNewUser
```

```text
POST /auth/refresh
Body: { "refreshToken": "..." }
```

```text
POST /auth/logout
Body: { "refreshToken": "..." }
```

Authentication uses email addresses only. SMS and phone-number login are not supported.

## Users

```text
GET   /users/me
PATCH /users/me
POST  /users/me/profile-image
POST  /users/me/change-password
POST  /users/me/delete-request
```

`PATCH /users/me` accepts `displayName`, `location`, and `notificationPreferences`. Profile images use the multipart upload route. Credential changes revoke all active sessions. Account deletion removes listings, clears device tokens, anonymizes the profile, and disables the account.

Suspended and deleted users are rejected by the authentication strategy.

## Listings

Public routes:

```text
GET /listings
GET /listings/:id
```

Authenticated seller routes:

```text
POST   /listings
GET    /listings/mine
PATCH  /listings/:id
DELETE /listings/:id
POST   /listings/:id/mark-sold
POST   /listings/:id/republish
```

`POST /listings` uses multipart form data with `photos` and the listing fields.
`PATCH /listings/:id` updates listing text/price/status-related fields only; replacing listing photos is not currently exposed as a seller endpoint.

## Favorites

```text
GET    /favorites
POST   /favorites
DELETE /favorites/:listingId
```

## Conversations

```text
POST /conversations
GET  /conversations
GET  /conversations/:id/messages
POST /conversations/:id/messages
POST /conversations/:id/read
```

Socket.IO clients authenticate with an access token in `handshake.auth.token`. Users may only join rooms for conversations where they are the buyer or seller.

Client event:

```text
joinConversation
```

Server event:

```text
messageCreated
```

## Blocking and reports

```text
POST   /blocks/:userId
DELETE /blocks/:userId
POST   /reports
```

Conversation reports require the reporter to be a participant.

## Push tokens

```text
POST /push-tokens
Body: { "token": "...", "platform": "android", "deviceId": "optional" }
```

## Admin

Admin routes are under `/admin` and require an access token with the current database role set to `admin`.

Main modules:

```text
/admin/dashboard
/admin/listings
/admin/users
/admin/reports
/admin/analytics/search
/admin/activity
```

## Development data

The seed script creates:

- one administrator
- one buyer
- 20 sellers
- 20 active listings
- sample favorites
- sample buyer and seller conversations

Development buyer email:

```text
buyer@pockettrade.local
```

Verification codes are sent by email through Mailjet and are not included in API responses.
